# Etch-a-Sketch

This is my etch-a-sketch project. Use your mouse to paint the grid with different colors. Each cell should go to black in 10 passes. Click the clear screen button to erase the current grid and create a new one based on your desired grid size. 
I am learning on The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)
